# Balancer V2 Vulnerability Analysis: Architecture Security Deep Dive

## 🎯 Project Overview
This repository contains my deep technical analysis of the Balancer V2 vulnerability that led to $128M+ in losses, with a focus on the architectural security implications and the V2→V3 evolution.

## 📚 Research Documents

| Document | Focus | Key Insight |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| [V2→V3 Architecture Analysis](./v2_to_v3_architecture_security_evolution.md) | **Primary Research** | Root cause analysis and security paradigm evolution |
| [Technical Analysis](./technical_analysis.md) | Vulnerability Deep Dive | Mathematical + access control exploit chain |
| [Access Control Restructuring](./access_control_restructuring.md) | Architecture Design | V2 to V3 permission model evolution |
| [Layered Defense Framework](./layered_defense_system.md) | Solution Design | Multi-layer security architecture |

## 🔍 Key Findings
- **Combined Vulnerability**: Mathematical precision attack + Access control failure
- **Architectural Root Cause**: V2's "God-mode" Vault design collapsed permission boundaries  
- **V3 Validation**: Predicted and validated the necessary architectural fixes

## 🎯 Research Value
This analysis demonstrates capability in:
- Original vulnerability research beyond surface-level reports
- Architecture-level security analysis
- Predictive solution design validated by actual protocol evolution
