## 3. Summary of Security Architecture Evolution

### 3.1 From "God Mode" to "Principle of Least Privilege"
- **V2**: Single contract with omnipotent capabilities, blurred permission boundaries
- **V3**: Microservices architecture with separation of duties and principle of least privilege

### 3.2 From "Implicit Trust" to "Explicit Verification"  
- **V2**: Assumed all operations were initiated in good faith
- **V3**: Verifies the source and intent of all operations

### 3.3 From "Economic Bypass" to "Path Enforcement"
- **V2**: Internal balances could bypass pool economic constraints
- **V3**: Mandates transactions through legitimate economic security pathways

## 4. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Permission Separation (Immediate)
- Split Vault responsibilities, introduce specialized managers
- Implement operation source tracing

### Phase 2: Fund Path Enforcement (Short-term)  
- Implement secure fund flow constraints
- Deploy timelock mechanisms

### Phase 3: Formal Verification (Long-term)
- Conduct formal verification of critical security properties
- Establish continuous security monitoring
